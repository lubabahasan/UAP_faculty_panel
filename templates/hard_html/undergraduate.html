        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <h2>Transfer Students</h2>
        <p>Credit transfer students from other universities are also considered for admission, however their application is considered case by case, taking into account their previous results and track record and also must pass the admission test if the department requires. The minimum GPA for the theory courses is “C” to be considered as transferable and “B” for programming labs. A transfer student must complete 50% of the required total credit hours of the program in the university to be eligible for a degree from UAP.

         For a student who has a study gap of more than two years prior to his application for admission is advised to make a contact directly to the admission office.

        If a credit transfer applicant is rusticated from his university due to actions going against the rules and regulations of that university will be considered ineligible for admission in UAP.</p>

        <h2>International Students</h2>
        <p>It is necessary for a prospective student from abroad to demonstrate commitment and readiness to operate in a different cultural context. The selection process is relatively similar, with options of submitting the necessary documents online. All documents must be translated in English and attested by legal authorities. The applicant must fulfill if the department asks for some special documents (i/e Portfolio, recommendation letter etc.) or interview (via Skype or telephone).
